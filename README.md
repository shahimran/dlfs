Demand Load Forecasting System
Demand Load forecasting is the process of predicting how much electricity will be needed at a given time and how that demand will affect the utility grid. It is used to ensure that enough power is available to meet consumption needs while avoiding waste and inefficiency.

Demand Load Forecasting is the backbone of a modern, reliable, and efficient power system. It’s essential for stability (frequency control, blackout prevention), planning, economic operation and load management.
